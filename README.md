# Bipartite peptide-protein-graphs

In bottom-up proteomics, intact proteins are digested to peptides via trypsin
before measurement by mass spectrometry based techniques. The relationship 
between peptides and proteins can naturally be presented as bipartite graphs, 
where there is one node type for proteins and one for peptides. An edge is drawn
if the peptide belongs to the peptide. Analysing the structure of these bipartite
graphs give a hint about the difficulty of protein quantification, especially
in presence of shared peptides. 

This R code belongs to the following manuscript:

The different R scripts have to be executed in the numbered order (00 to 05).
